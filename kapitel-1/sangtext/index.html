    <h1>Hate it or love it</h1>
    <h2>LÃ¥ttexten</h2>
    <p>Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl<br>
        Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world<br>
        Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies<br>
        My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check, check out my melody"<br>
        I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope<br>
        For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes<br>
        Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat<br>
        If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope<br>
        Tossed and turned in my sleep that night<br>
        Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike<br>
        Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
        I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could</p>
    <p>Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top<br>
        And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop<br>
        <em>Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P</em><br>
        <em>And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me</em><br>
        Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top<br>
        And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop<br>
        <em>Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P</em><br>
        <em>And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me</em><br>
        (G-G-G-G-G-Unit!)
    </p>
    <p>On the grill of my lowrider<br>
        Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires<br>
        I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song<br>
        And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter<br>
        10 G's will take your daugh ter out her Air Forces<br>
        Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses<br>
        I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious<br>
        One phone call I'll have your body dumped in Marcy<br>
        I stay strapped like car seats<br>
        Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys<br>
        That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95<br>
        I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's<br>
        Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride<br>
        And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide<br>
        I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died<br>
        Now I'm going back to Cali<br>
        With my Jacob on, see how time fly?</p>
    <p>Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top<br>
        And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop<br>
        <em>Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P</em><br>
         <em>And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me</em><br>
        Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top<br>
        And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop<br>
        <em>Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P</em><br>
        And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me</p>
    <p>From the beginning to the end<br>
        Losers lose, winners win<br>
        This is real, we ain't got to pretend<br>
        The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain<br>
        Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game</p>
    <p>Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench<br>
        Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense<br>
        My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent<br>
        And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz<br>
        Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range<br>
        Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes<br>
        When there's kids starvin'<br>
        Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage<br>
        I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin<br>
        No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins<br>
        Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted<br>
        I think, "What if Marie Baker got that abortion?" I love you, ma<br></p>
    <p>Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top<br>
        And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop<br>
        <em>Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P</em><br>
         <em>And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me</em><br>
        Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top<br>
        And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop<br>
        <em>Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P</em><br>
         <em>And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me</em><br></p>
